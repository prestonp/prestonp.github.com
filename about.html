  <p>
    I am currently in Bartlesville, Oklahoma working for ConocoPhillips in Information Technology (ooooh! ahhhhh!)

I grew up in Houston, Texas and studied CS at University of Texas at Austin (the best school in the world)

I have a dog Oliver that likes to chew on anything and everything. He is quite snappy but I like him.

My current love interest is Kim-Jamy Nguyen, who is teaching english half way across the world in a little place called Penghou off the coast of Taiwan. She is pretty cool. Fact: We went to prom together - hehe
